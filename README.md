# algoTrainingWithTests

Welcome to my little alogo TDD training. 
When I come across problems I can't solve in one sitting, I add them to this repo and over time work on them untill I reach a solution. 

It helps me to wrap my head around alogs as well as it exposes me to some easy testing that we all love when coding, not when we write tests though.

Using Mocha and Chai for now, and hope to dive deeper as I go.
